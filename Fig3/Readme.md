draw_quartiles.m  - draws Fig.3 from paper. Function uses results from  files "Cheb14_bet9.mat" and "Monom14_bet9.mat"

Data files are generated by function "runBoth.m", which separetaly executes "Cheb/runAll.m" and "Monom/runAll.m". Warning: execution of these functions is very time consuming (i.e. may need more than 24h run) also requires "Parallel Computing Toolbox".
